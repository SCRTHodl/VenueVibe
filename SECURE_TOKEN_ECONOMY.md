# Secure Token Economy Implementation Guide

## Overview of Changes

We've completely restructured your token economy implementation to follow security best practices. The key issue was that your application was using the Supabase service role key in client-side code, which poses a significant security risk.

### The Security Problem

- The service role key (`VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) has admin-level permissions
- This key was being exposed in client-side code (anything with a `VITE_` prefix)
- Anyone could extract this key from your frontend and gain admin access to your database

### The Secure Solution

1. Created a Supabase Edge Function (`token-economy`) that securely handles all token economy operations
2. Created a client utility (`tokenEconomyClient.ts`) to interface with this edge function
3. Updated all token economy operations to use this secure approach
4. Properly structured environment variables to separate client-side and server-side keys

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Your Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should be updated to follow this new structure:

```bash
# CLIENT-SIDE VARIABLES (with VITE_ prefix - WILL be exposed in the browser)
# Main Supabase Configuration for client operations
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jvmfmgkpkkoqmhzrbzyz.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# SERVER-SIDE VARIABLES (no VITE_ prefix - will NOT be exposed in browser)
# These are only for Supabase Edge Functions or your backend server
SUPABASE_URL=https://jvmfmgkpkkoqmhzrbzyz.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### 2. Deploy the Edge Function

Deploy the token-economy edge function to your Supabase project:

```bash
cd /Users/kaizencode/Downloads/project\ 6
supabase functions deploy token-economy
```

### 3. Set Edge Function Secrets

Set the necessary secrets for your edge function using the VITE-prefixed variables:

```bash
supabase secrets set VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jvmfmgkpkkoqmhzrbzyz.supabase.co
supabase secrets set VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Note:** We're using the VITE-prefixed variables because the non-prefixed versions were rejected by Supabase. The edge function has been updated to look for these variables.

### 4. Update Your Supabase Dashboard Configuration

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Settings > API
2. Verify the list of exposed schemas includes `token_economy`
3. Set up proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies for your token_economy tables

## How It Works

### Edge Function

The edge function (`token-economy`) handles all operations on the token_economy schema:

1. Receives requests with a valid JWT token (from authenticated users)
2. Validates the user's identity
3. Uses the service role key securely on the server-side
4. Applies the correct schema access pattern (`.schema('token_economy').from('table_name')`)
5. Returns only data the user is authorized to access

### Client Utility

The `tokenEconomyClient.ts` utility:

1. Gets the current user's access token
2. Sends authenticated requests to the edge function
3. Handles error states and provides a clean API for token operations

## Security Benefits

This implementation:

1. ✅ Keeps the service role key secure (server-side only)
2. ✅ Maintains proper authentication
3. ✅ Follows best practices for schema access
4. ✅ Improves code organization
5. ✅ Prevents unauthorized data access

## Testing

After deployment, you should test the following:

1. Token wallet initialization
2. Earning tokens
3. Spending tokens
4. Purchasing tokens
5. Viewing transaction history
